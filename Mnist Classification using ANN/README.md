This project classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The dataset contains 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28×28 pixels.
Images were flattened into vectors and normalized to improve learning performance. A multilayer ANN was trained to learn digit patterns based on pixel information.
This project demonstrates image preprocessing, neural network construction, and digit recognition using deep learning fundamentals.

Technologies & Libraries Used : Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

This project classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, dogs, and more. 
The dataset contains 60,000 colored images of size 32×32.
The data was normalized and reshaped before training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The model learns hierarchical image features such as edges, textures, and object shapes to perform accurate image classification.
The trained CNN model helps demonstrate deep learning concepts, image preprocessing, and feature extraction for real-world computer vision tasks.

Technologies & Libraries Used : Python, TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

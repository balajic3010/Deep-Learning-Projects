This project predicts house prices using the Boston Housing dataset based on features such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, and distance to employment centers.
The dataset was normalized to improve neural network performance, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained to learn relationships between housing features and median home values.
This project focuses on regression modeling using deep learning, demonstrating how ANN can be applied to real-estate price estimation tasks by learning continuous value outputs.

Technologies & Libraries Used : Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas
